üë∑ Spring Boot back-end _currently being written_ in Kotlin for an application I hope I can start developing soon.

---

### Run as in production

```shell
docker rmi -f qrivi/fappserver # Optional, ensures latest image is fetched
docker-compose up
```
This will fetch a PostgreSQL image and the `fappserver` image from Docker Hub, and run as intended for production.

### Other cool things

```shell
./gradlew clean build jibDockerBuild
```
This will build a local Docker image with `fappserver` deployed.

```shell
docker-compose run --service-ports fappstore
```
This will spin up a PostgreSQL image that's ready for `fappserver` to connect to. Nifty during development if you want to deploy locally but don't want to install PostgreSQL on your machine. üëç
