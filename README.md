üë∑ Spring Boot back-end _currently being written_ in Kotlin for an application I hope I can start developing soon.

### Run as in production

- Fetch a PostgreSQL image and the `nuntium-server` image from Docker Hub, and run as intended for production.
```shell
docker rmi -f qrivi/nuntium-server # Optional, ensures latest image is fetched
docker-compose up
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Will give errors for now, as database won't have been set up properly, and `nuntium-server` image on DockerHub is out of date (too early to put much time in Docker).

### Run for development

- Run the database from the PostgreSQL Docker image in `docker-compose.yml`.
```shell
docker-compose run --service-ports nuntium-store
```

- Local database works too, if you create user, password and database (already done if using Docker).
```shell
psql -c "CREATE ROLE nuntium_user WITH LOGIN superuser PASSWORD 'nuntium_password';"
psql -c "CREATE DATABASE nuntium_loc WITH OWNER nuntium_user;"
```

- Set up the database with the nifty Liquibase Gradle plugin.
```shell
./gradlew dropAll update -PrunList=main
```

- Deploy and run a `nuntium-server` instance.
```shell
./gradlew bootRun
```

### Other cool things

- Build a local Docker image with `nuntium-server` deployed.
```shell
./gradlew clean build jibDockerBuild
```
